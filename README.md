## About the project 
The Greygarth sphere is being developed as a side-project in the free time for student accommodation "Greygarth" located in Manchester, United Kingdom. The main goal is to digitilise the communication between residents and management of the residence. 

The following features are currently in the development: 
1. Events announcements system.
2. Resident management system.
3. Catering management including online meal registration for catered dinners and lunches.
4. Admin dashboard for the residence management staff.
5. Dashboard for the catering team.

## Inspiration
The idea appeard due to inefficiency of WhatsApp serving as the main communication and announcement channel. Additionally, residents face a problem of manual meal registration with pen and paper. Greygarth is a catered hall providing dinners and lunches for its residence on a daily bases. However, each resident has to make sure to be registered for a meal before 9.00 AM for the given day. Due to a human factor it may create additional work for the catering staff if the person is registered, but forgot to sign out for the lunch/dinner. Moreover, the food cooked on those residents who do not show up may be saved and used in the future.
